Step 1: Create a Dedicated User Account
1. Open a terminal on your Linux system or on WSL ubuntu application which I used.
2. Run the following command to create a new user account named "recorduser":
   ```
   sudo useradd recorduser
   ```

Step 2: Set a Strong Password for the User Account
1. Set a password for the "recorduser" account using the following command:
   ```
   sudo passwd recorduser
   ```
   You will be prompted to enter and confirm the password.

Step 3: Create the File Structure
1. Log in as the "recorduser" by switching to the new user account:
   ```
   sudo su - recorduser
   ```
2. Use your preferred text editor (e.g., Nano or Gedit) to create the file structure. For example, using Nano:
   ```
   nano Personal_Record_System.txt
   ```

   Enter the following file structure in the text editor:
   ```
   Personal_Record_System/
   ├── credentials/
   │ ├── usernames.txt
   │ ├── passwords.txt
   │ └── email_addresses.txt
   ├── notes/
   │ ├── personal_notes.txt
   │ └── important_dates.txt
   └── backups/
   ├── backup_2023-06-13.zip
   └── backup_2023-06-20.zip
   ```
   Save the file.

Step 4: Set Restrictive Permissions
1. Set restrictive permissions on the personal record files using the "chmod" command:
   ```
   chmod 600 Personal_Record_System/credentials/usernames.txt
   chmod 600 Personal_Record_System/credentials/passwords.txt
   chmod 600 Personal_Record_System/credentials/email_addresses.txt
   chmod 600 Personal_Record_System/notes/personal_notes.txt
   chmod 600 Personal_Record_System/notes/important_dates.txt
   ```

Step 5: Create Backups for All Files
1. Navigate to the "backups" directory:
   ```
   cd Personal_Record_System/backups
   ```
2. Create backup files. Replace the filenames with actual backup filenames:
   ```
   touch backup_2023-06-13.zip
   touch backup_2023-06-20.zip
   ```
   You can use tools like `zip` or `tar` to create actual backups of your files.

Now you have created a dedicated user account for the Personal Record Management System, set a strong password, created the file structure, set restrictive permissions, and created backups for your files. Remember to regularly update and backup your files to ensure data integrity and security.
