            <h3>Goat Wet Fry</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Wash your goat with lime and water (if this is your cooking practice).</li>
                <li>Season your goat generously with salt and let it sit for about 30 minutes.</li>
                <li>In a heavy bottom pan on medium heat, add your oil.</li>
                <li>Add your goat and brown. if you pan is too crowded, you can brown in batches and return your goat to the pan.</li>
                <li>Cover for goat and let simmer in its own juices for 15 minutes on low heat.</li>
                <li>After 15 minutes, add your sliced onion, mix well and cover and let simmer for 5 minutes on low heat.</li>
                <li>Next, add your garlic, ginger and hot pepper and mix in well.</li>
                <li>Cover your goat again and let simmer for an addition 15 minutes on low heat. Goat can be tough so a lot of simmering is needed to get a perfectly tender goat.</li>
                <li>Add all your dry spices and herbs and mix well.</li>
                <li>Add your diced tomatoes and mix well.</li>
                <li>Cover your goat and let simmer for 15 minutes on low. You may have to check periodically to store so it does not burn.</li>
                <li>After 15 minutes, add about 2 cups of water and let your goat simmer, covered (with your lid placed slight off so heat can escape) on low heat.</li>
                <li>Simmer for an additional 15 – 30 minutes, adding water as needed until your goat is tender.</li>
                <li>Finally, add your diced bell peppers, cover and simmer for 10 minutes until peppers are cooked and wilted and goat meat ‘drys out’. The goat should have very little liquid. You may want to simmer without a lid if your goat has a lot of liquid.</li>
                <li>The end result should be tender pieces of goat, in a thick, flavourful sauce and visible pieces of bell peppers.</li>
                <li>Set aside until ready to serve.</li>
                        
        </li>

            <h3>Sukuma Wiki Collard Greens</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>In a pan, add a tablespoon of oil.</li>
                <li>Add your onions and sauté until translucent. This should take about 3 minutes.</li>
                <li>In a pan, add a tablespoon of oil.</li>
                <li>Add your onions and sautee until translucent. This should take about 3 minutes</li>
                <li>Add your tomatoes and and satuee until softened.</li>
                <li>Add your sliced collard greens, you can finely slice or even chop your leaves or leave them or leave them a little thick if you would like.</li>
                <li>Add them to your pan with onion and tomato, cover with a lid and turn your heat down.</li>
                <li>Let your greens steam for about a minute or two, give them a good stir so nothing burns and add a splash of water just to help with steaming.</li>
                <li>You can let your collard greens steam for as little as 10-15 minutes, they will be bright green and wilted but still have a lot of bite or you can cover and let steam, stirring periodically for up for 30 minutes.</li>
                <li>The colour of the collard greens becomes a bit duller but they are cooked down more. Season with salt to taste near the end of cooking and I like to add cumin as well.</li>
                <li>Set aside until ready to serve.</li>

            <h3>Kachumbari</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Add all ingredients into a bowl, mix well, and adjust seasoning to taste.</li>

            <h3>Ugali</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Fill a small but deep pot with water, bring to a boil.</li>
                <li>Add salt to taste.(optional)</li>
                <li>Fill a cup with water and keep it beside the stove.</li>
                <li>Add your corn meal and continue stirring with a wooden spoon.</li>
                <li>Add water as needed so cornmeal cooks but is not too wet.</li>
                <li>Cornmeal will thicken and you will need to start kneading with your wooden spoon.</li>
                <li>Turn the heat down and keep kneading til your italic starts to dry out. </li>
                <li>You want it to be a really thick texture, almost like thick mashed potatoes.</li>
                <li>Transfer your ugali into two or three small wet bowls, depending on the serving size you want.</li>
                <li>Let cool slightly so that is thickens further and move your ugali around in the bowl so it smoothens out on the bottom.</li>
                <li> Depending on how soft my ugali is, I sometimes let it cool significantly so it can firm up even more.</li>
                <li>When ready to serve, take your boule out of your bowl and serve your ugali with side.</li>
                <li>I usually make my ugali last so that is is fresh when I am eating and does not need any reheating.</li>
